Version 0.75 -- 05/15/2002
   GG -- Changed the program to run as a true daemon now, forking into the
         backround properly
   GG -- Added some signal hooks to allow the program to be shut down with a
         killall upnpd.
   GG -- Removed some of the excessive debugging found in previous version in
         /var/log/debug.
   GG -- Made some relevant changes to the INSTALL, README, and SECURITY files.
   GG -- Placed the code into CVS on source forge.
   GG -- Usage now prints to STDOUT where it should have in the first place.
   GG -- When the daemon is running, in Windows a connection description now 
         shows up in Network Connections representing the gateway connection.
         Windows has always recognized it this way, but until now you didn't
         have a way to view the connection details.

Version 0.71 -- 05/03/2002
   GG -- Ok I goofed, and still had it statically grabbing one of the ip
         addresses.  This is the real officil first real official release,
         so let us know what you think.  

Version 0.70 -- 05/03/2002
   GG -- First public release of the software.  We figure it's time to share
         the glory and the shame.
