Things on the table to do:

-- Add command line options to the program to run as a daemon, change directory info, etc. 
   and basically make it run like a real program. Haha.

-- Modularize some of the low level stuff like the firewall code interface, etc., to allow
   people to have different firewall software packages, etc.  This is one of my main goals, 
   allowing people to use this sotware with different types of programs.

-- Add some DHCP hooks to the program to give clients an IP address, etc.

-- Add more stuff to the to do list!!!
